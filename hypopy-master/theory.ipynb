    "The nonlinear joint hypocenter-velocity inversion problem is solved by iterating the linearized problem, following the separation of parameters technique described by Pavlis and Booker (1980).  Three types of constraints are applied to the velocity models. To prevent wild fluctuations in the velocity structures at poorly resolved nodes, a smoothness constraint is added. This is accomplished by minimizing the spatial velocity derivatives in addition to the arrivai time residuals. Another constraint is applied to keep the velocities within specified bounds. It is implemented by applying a penalty for velocities which fall outside the desired range, and then minimizing the penalties during the subsequent iteration. With the last type of velocity constraint, velocities computed from independent surveys are used to directly constrain the velocity model at certain points within the grid.\n",

The goal is to change the model parameters so that the new calculated arrivai time, $t_c$ + $\\Delta t_c$ is equal to the observed arrivai time\n",

Similarly, the larger the value of $\\gamma$, the more strongly the velocities are constrained within the defined ranges; and the larger the value of $\\alpha$, the more strongly the velocities are constrained to match the values obtained from other surveys.

    "Recall that the partial derivatives in the matrix $\\mathbf{H}_i$ depend on the current event location. Therefore, the algorithm is stable if the corrections $\\Delta\\mathbf{h}_i$ are small. Following the advice of Roecker (1982), the solution is found progressively, in order to minimize the effects of nonlinearity. Specifically, the hypocenter latitude and longitude are allowed to vary first, since they are almost always the most stable parameters. After these two parameters have converged, the depth and origin time are also allowed to vary - that is, all four parameters are now varying. The reason for solving the inversion progressively is that by allowing the two most stable parameters to vary first, the residuals are reduced. This means that the sizes of the corrections $\\Delta\\mathbf{h}_i$ that occur when the less stable parameters are allowed to vary have probably been decreased, thereby reducing the effects of nonlinearity.\n",
